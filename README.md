Project Description: Finding Vulnerabilities through Penetration Testing
This project focuses on Penetration Testing, an ethical security exercise aimed at identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in a computer system. The objective is to uncover weak spots in a system’s defenses that could be exploited by attackers. This controlled testing environment ensures legality and safety while demonstrating real-world attack scenarios.

Key Features:
Simulated Attack Environment:

The project uses Metasploitable2 as the target system. This is a deliberately vulnerable virtual machine designed for learning and practicing penetration testing techniques.
Kali Linux, a popular penetration testing platform, serves as the attacker system.
Virtualization Setup:

Both systems are run on Oracle VirtualBox, creating an isolated and safe environment for testing.
Virtualization ensures no impact on actual physical systems and adheres to ethical guidelines.
Purpose of Penetration Testing:

Identifies and documents vulnerabilities in the target system.
Explores how attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities.
Provides insights into improving system defenses to mitigate potential risks.
How It Works:
Setup Phase:

Install and configure Oracle VirtualBox to host the attacker (Kali Linux) and target (Metasploitable2) systems.
Ensure proper network configuration (e.g., NAT or Host-Only Adapter) for secure communication between the virtual machines.
Attack Phase:

Use tools and utilities within Kali Linux, such as:
Nmap for network scanning and identifying open ports.
Metasploit Framework for exploiting vulnerabilities and gaining access to the target system.
Perform various tests, including enumeration, vulnerability scanning, and exploitation.
Reporting Phase:

Document identified vulnerabilities, the tools used, and steps taken to exploit the system.
Provide recommendations to fix or mitigate the discovered issues.
Example Use Case:
A cybersecurity student or professional simulates a real-world hacking scenario to practice ethical hacking techniques.
The project demonstrates the process of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.
It serves as a practical introduction to penetration testing and cybersecurity concepts.
Possible Extensions:
Advanced Target Systems: Expand the scope to test vulnerabilities on more advanced platforms (e.g., web servers, databases).
Custom Scripts: Develop scripts to automate vulnerability scanning and exploitation.
Reporting Tool: Implement a tool to generate detailed reports of findings, including remediation steps.
This project provides hands-on experience in ethical hacking and penetration testing using industry-standard tools and practices. It’s a safe and effective way to understand how attackers think and how to strengthen system security against real-world threats.
